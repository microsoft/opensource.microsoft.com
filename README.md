# opensource.microsoft.com

The `opensource.microsoft.com` web site is a simple, factual web site sharing information about Microsoft's
open source program, the open source ecosystem that we support, and opportunities to get involved in projects

Most of the content is static, and Next.js is now used to generate that modern static site, ported from an
old Jekyll site. The rendered site is retrieved at runtime by a separate site hosting solution.

Created by the Microsoft Open Source Programs Office (OSPO), in partnership with Microsoft's One Engineering System (1ES) team,
the site launched in August 2020, replacing an antiquated prior site. We expect that limited updates and contributions to
the site will be made by Microsoft teams.

We do not currently have plans to add drastically different sections to the site or to be the "source of truth" 
for blog posts or other content. We're able to accept some coordinated contributions or suggestions, but request
coordination in issues before embarking on new functionality, as the site has a set of requirements to meet such
as being WCAG 2.1 accessible, and deploying to Microsoft's cloud.

The primary site navigation is:

- Homepage overview
- Get involved
- Projects
- Ecosystem
- Our program

Other content includes:

- Jobs (an external link)
- Blog (a separate site hosted at `/blog` via the front door)
- Code of Conduct text
- Community Resources
- a "thank you" page about the open source powering the project
- OpenAtMicrosoft X account
- This repository

# Telemetry

By default, this project **does not include telemetry**; however, the GitHub Actions may generate the production version of the site without modification.

When the Jekyll build environment is set to Microsoft's production environment name - "opensource.microsoft.com" -
Microsoft's standard cookie compliance and analytics code to connect with Application Insights is included in the site.

* **Data Collection**. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send it to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may turn off the telemetry as described in the repository. There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with a copy of Microsoft's privacy statement.

# Development

Ensure you have a modern Node.js environment.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The `Dockerfile` is available to host a local `nginx` version of the static site,
although dynamic site features are not available when running local.
