# opensource.microsoft.com :globe_with_meridians:

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the https://opensource.microsoft.com web site.

We're happy that this site is open source (because an open source site should be open source). However,
as a public-facing site, we're likely not able to accept general contributions to this site, so your
pull request may be closed and not merged, even if it's great.

Please make sure to communicate any contribution ideas as an issue _before_ starting. We'd love to see
how to involve you.

# Submitting featured projects and ecosystem content

For projects and ecosystem page content, Microsoft employees (identified as having a "link" between
their corporate account and their GitHub account, as detailed at [aka.ms/opensource](https://aka.ms/opensource))
can submit a pull request with changes or new YAML for consideration in these sections.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
