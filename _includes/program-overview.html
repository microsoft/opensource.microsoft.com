        The Microsoft open source program is managed by the Open Source Programs Office
        in partnership with expert teams across Microsoft. A community of open source
        experts, open source leaders, and others help curate guidance and policy.

    <h4 class="h4">One Engineering System (1ES)</h4>
    <p>
        The 1ES team at Microsoft has made using,
        releasing and contributing to open source an easy, efficient, native
        part of the engineering experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Building on a foundation of <strong>eliminate</strong> (reducing complex and dated 
        policies for the modern engineering era), <strong>automate</strong> (detecting open
        source use, automated policy and decision guides, legal alerts and security workflows),
        and <strong>delegate</strong> (letting business groups make decisions aligned with
        their priorities and goals), the open source program has scaled.

    <ul class="ul mt-4">
        <li>
            <b>Built into the engineering system:</b>
            Powered by GitHub and Azure Pipelines, and internal hyperscale 
            CloudBuild, CloudTest, and policy systems, many tasks as simple as
            maintaining an inventory of the open source used in builds and products
            is automatic.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Using GitHub Enterprise Cloud:</b>
            Over 60,000 engineers at Microsoft are using 
            <a href="https://github.com" class="link-standard" target="_new">GitHub Enterprise Cloud</a> 
            to host and release official Microsoft open source projects, samples,
            and documentation, building communities and connecting directly with
            technologists and Microsoft customers right on GitHub, working in the open.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="h4">Expert support &amp; resources</h4>
    <p>
        A coalition of teams, experts, and friendly resources are available
        to make sure that everyone at Microsoft understands how to use open source.
    </p>

    <ul class="ul mt-4">
        <li>
            <b>Easy, crisp guidance for engineers:</b>
            Comprehensive reference material for everyone at Microsoft to refer to
            helps to share knowledge and reduce confusion. Checklists, policies and
            advanced guides have been prepared by Subject Matter Experts, open source attorneys, and 
            curated by engineers, to make learning about using open source easy and efficient.

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Open Source Standards and Legal Team:</b>
            Expert attorneys and program managers with decades of open source experience
            from across the industry make up the legal team that crafts policies, guidance,
            and inform their clients regarding all their licensing and open community needs. 
            Every employee at Microsoft has access to an open source attorney dedicated to their
            organization and familiar with their business goals and unique needs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Open Source Champs:</b>
            Internal e-mail discussion lists and Microsoft Teams channels make it
            easy and straightforward to connect with open source maintainers and
            experts to get answers.
            
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The Open Source Champs come from teams across Microsoft and are able to
            help advise their team and help share knowledge. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Business and Legal review process:</b>
            Some open source activities at the company, depending on use case, license,
            or other conditions, may automatically trigger a straightforward business and legal
            review process.

            <br/>
            <br/>
            An open source review takes the form of a standard engineering work
            item and presents reviewers with a contextual look at the business goals, specific
            use scenario, and other aspects, to help make the right decisions for some scenarios.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Open Source Executive Council:</b>
            Essentially the board of directors for the open source program, the
            executive council consists of leaders from across Microsoft. The council
            helps to guide the program, highlight opportunities, and provide a 
            central place for decisions regarding open source.

    <h4 class="h4">OpenChain 2.1 conformance</h4>
    <p>
        Trust is key to open source. Developers should be able to trust users to 
        respect their licensing choices. And when you receive software, you should 
        be able to trust that the open source licenses were followed.
    </p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.openchainproject.org/" target="_new">OpenChain Project</a> 
        plays an important role in building trust by setting standards that define how to operate a 
        high-quality open source compliance program. It means that when you receive open source from a 
        company that follows the OpenChain standard, you can be assured that the code went through a rigorous 
        license compliance process. You can trust it.

        We <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2019/12/12/announcing-microsoft-openchain-conformance/" target="_new">
            announced that Microsoft is OpenChain 2.0-conformant
        </a> in December 2019 and continue to keep the program up-to-date, most recently self-certifying OpenChain 2.1 requirements.
