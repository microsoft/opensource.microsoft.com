description: "QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer. Virtualization is a fundamental piece for effective OS development and beyond, be it emulating a bare-metal K8s environment or testing software on various OSes. QEMU also enables users to run an operating system other than there current one."
context: "QEMU is the most universal virtualization software and I consider it a critical infrastructure. It also enables binary translation to execute foreign architecture binaries (e.g. container images)."
