# opensource.microsoft.com :globe_with_meridians:

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the https://opensource.microsoft.com web site.

We're happy that this site is open source (because an open source site should be open source). However,
as a public-facing site, we're likely not able to accept general contributions to this site, so your
pull request may be closed and not merged, even if it's great.

Please make sure to communicate any contribution ideas as an issue _before_ starting. We'd love to see
how to involve you.

# Submitting featured projects and ecosystem content

For projects and ecosystem page content, Microsoft employees (identified as having a "link" between
their corporate account and their GitHub account, as detailed at [aka.ms/opensource](https://aka.ms/opensource))
can submit a pull request with changes or new YAML for consideration in these sections.

# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.
